### V92's Personal Source Config Files

These are a bunch of customized .CFG and otherwise files used in a variety of Source games.

While each game has a "split and not entirely equal" method of design, many of the commands may or may not work outside specific games.

It is advisable to couple the .CFG per-game with the launch command as follows:
### +exec _(game name).cfg

For example, in GMod use the following:
### +exec _gmod.cfg

Feel free to customize to your own liking, and in fact that is encouraged.

If you want to add or make a recommended change to any of the files, feel free to submit a request to them.

Have fun.
